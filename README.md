# Layout like App with JPEG Camera and Canvas.

The current repository is a demo application built for Sitepoint's article [Accessing the Userâ€™s Camera with JpegCamera and Canvas](https://www.sitepoint.com/jpegcamera-and-canvas/).

It cointains the soure code for an application that emulates what [Instagram's Layout](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.layout) does. It relies on [HTML 5 Canvas](https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-canvas-tutorial-introduction/) capabilites together with [JPEG Camera JS library](https://github.com/amw/jpeg_camera).

I hope you enjoy it.
